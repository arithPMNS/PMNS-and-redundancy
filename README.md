# PMNS-and-redundancy
This repository contains code to generate PMNS, for efficient modular arithmetic. It also allows to perform some analyses such as the redundancy. The implementations are done using SageMath library http://www.sagemath.org/.
<br />
<br />
Here are the descriptions of the files in this repository:
 - pmns_generator.sage: contains functions to generate efficient PMNS, given a prime number.
 - EXAMPLE__pmns_gen.sage: shows how to use the PMNS generator. 
 - pmns_arith_ops.sage: contains functions for arithmetic and conversion operations in the PMNS. It also contains all the tools to study the redundancy in the PMNS, unique representation computations and equality check.
 - EXAMPLE__redund.sage: presents examples of arithmetic and conversion operations, representation computations and equality check.
